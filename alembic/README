To find out how to work with migrations read the docs

https://alembic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autogenerate.html

you can work on a specific TKP database by settings these
environment variables:

 - TKP_DBENGINE
 - TKP_DBNAME
 - TKP_DBUSER
 - TKP_DBPASSWORD
 - TKP_DBHOST
 - TKP_DBPORT

This is similar to how we configure the test suite:

http://tkp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devref/procedures/testing.html#database

annoying thing is that for now you also need to set the database config
in the alembic.ini file (sqlalchemy.url)

basically to create a migration you should modify the model and then run:

$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

and then check the generated migration.

An end user can then upgrade to the latest version using:

$ alembic upgrade head
