You can use this Django project for creating a schema of your database.  On an
Ubuntu or Debian system, the following procedure should work:

 #. ``sudo-apt-get install python-django-extensions python-pydot``.
 #. Edit ``settings.py`` to reflect your database settings.
 #. Run ``update.sh``

 A ``schema.png`` file will be saved to your working directory.
